As a team composed of Epitech students, we always had a fascination for
low-level technologies and performances, because of how we learned

abstraction.

Day after day, web pages become more and more bloated, slow and hard to
navigate and, like everyone, we are tired of it.

Then we heard about [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/), promising a
compilation target close to assembly and executable by browsers. This would
allow people to code in a language they like for the Web, great !

Around the same time, we also learned about
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a language both safe and fast, and who

replace existing Javascript in web applications, to gain performance easily
and instantly.
