## Install a module

First, install the [Command Line Tool](https://github.com/dessert-wasm/cli#installation),
it will greatly simplify the process.

### Choose a module to install

It is necessary to define what library used in your app can be replaced by a
Dessert module. To do so, to methods exist :

1. Manually browse the [Dessert website](http://dessert.dev)
2. Use the `recommend` command from the Dessert CLI

The `recommend` command will run through your project's dependencies and
check for each of them if an existing Dessert equivalent exists, then display
a list of modules likely to interest you. You can then install these modules
if you want, or pick the one you are interested in.

### Replace a dependency

It's recommended to first check a module's documentation before installing it
because some details on installation or usage may vary.

Then, install the Dessert module :

```bash
npm install <module_name>
```

Next, you have to replace in your code the occurrences where you use the
replaced library (the one you are replacing for a Dessert module).

Eventually, remove it. For example:

```bash
npm remove <old_library>
```

If everything went well, your app just gained performance !

Some demonstration are available
[here](https://github.com/dessert-wasm/dessert-demo) or [over here](https://github.com/dessert-wasm/dessert-filesize-demo).

### Got an error?

‚ö†Ô∏è  Dessert (and more generally WASM modules) use asynchronous `import`s.
Here is what importing a module looks like:

```
let myModule;
myModule = await import('some-dessert-module')
```
